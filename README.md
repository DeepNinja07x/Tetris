# Tetris
It's the old school Tetris game where the player have to stop the pieces from reaching the top of the screen only by removing the pieces by filling up the blank space in a line. The Game is made using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. The controls are also very simple; UP Arrow to change the shape, DOWN Arrow to move the piece downwards, RIGHT Arrow to move right, and LEFT Arrow to move left.
